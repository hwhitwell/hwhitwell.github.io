                    <p class="margin-5-5 no-margin-bottom no-margin-rl text-large text-gray-dark-2">A novel coronavirus was recently discovered and termed SARS-CoV-2. Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which, at this point, over 80,000 cases resulting in over 2,500 deaths have been reported in over 40 countries. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses. However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-19 infection and reveal that drugs targeting pathways prevent viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell culture model for infection with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Employing this system, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 infection profile by translatome and proteome proteomics at different times after infection.

                        These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways, such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism. Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways were tested in cellular infection assays and prevented viral replication. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication. We anticipate our results to guide efforts to develop therapy options for COVID-19</p>

He obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge (UK) where he performed his thesis work in Anne Bertolotti’s laboratory at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, UK). His graduate work focused on the folding and prion-like properties of mutant SOD1 in the context amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and earned him the prestigious British Neuroscience Association Postgraduate Award. After his graduation, Christian joined the laboratory of Wade Harper at the Harvard Medical School with an EMBO long-term fellowship to study protein quality control in mitochondria, particularly the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Christian started as an independent group leader at the Institute of Biochemistry II in December 2016. His main research interests focus on mitochondrial quality control, in particular in determining the processes involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and its role in human diseases.</p>
